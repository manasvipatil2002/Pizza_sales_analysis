## Project Overview:
The PIZZA Sales Database project is designed to manage and analyze the sales data of various pizza orders. It utilizes a relational database structure to store detailed information about each order, including the type of pizza, quantity ordered, and associated order IDs. This project aims to streamline the tracking of pizza sales, enabling better inventory management and sales analysis for pizzerias.

## Key Features:
* Database Structure:
   The project creates a database named PIZZA_SALES with a table called ORDER_DETAILS.
  
* Data Entries:
   The ORDER_DETAILS table includes fields for order details such as order_details_id, order_id, pizza_id, and quantity.

* Extensive Data:
   The project contains numerous entries representing different pizza types and their quantities ordered, allowing for c 
   omprehensive data analysis.


## Project Objectives:

* Data Management: 
     To provide a structured way to store and manage pizza order data efficiently.

* Sales Analysis:
    To enable analysis of sales trends based on different pizza types, which can inform inventory decisions and marketing 
       strategies.

* Reporting Capabilities:
    To facilitate the generation of reports that summarize sales data, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.

 *  Scalability:
    To create a database that can be easily expanded with additional tables or fields as needed to accommodate future 
    requirements.
